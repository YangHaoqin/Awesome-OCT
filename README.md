### Datasets
#### Rose
ROSE It consists of two subsets: ROSE-1 and ROSE-2.
ROSE-1 subset consists of a total of 117 OCTA images from 39 subjects (26 with disease  and the rest are healthy control) and was split into 90 images for training and 27 images for testing. Each subject has en face angiograms of superficial (SVC), deep (DVC), and the inner retinal vascular plexus that includes both SVC and DVC (SVC+DVC) respectively. 
ROSE-2 subset contains a total of 112 OCT-A images of 112 eyes acquired by Heidelberg OCT2 system with Spectralis software (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) and was split into 90 images for training and 22 images for testing.
